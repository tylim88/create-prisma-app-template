**\*The project generator is in the making to provide better install experience**

## Intro

This package is aim to get you up and running in different environments, in general there are 4 types of environments:

1. dev(dev.env)
   Ideally dev is an environment that allow us to code and experimenting our thing even without internet. It is an environment that we can carry on planning and creating without relying third party service such as server on AWS, instead we should have a server that we can toy with anytime in our computer.

2. prod(prod.env)
   Prod is the environment where we want to treat our data, data model and configuration delicately. Imagine if we accidentally deploy our dev data and configuration into prod, that would be hell unleashed.For some cases we can mix up test and dev environments and that is tolerable, but production environment MUST has it own space, this is not an option.

3. test(test.env)  
   Ideally the test environment should be as similar as prod environment as possible so that we can expect the same behavior when we deploy it, do not confuse this with jest.

4. jest(jest.env)  
   Do not confuse this with test, jest has its own environment variables that points to test environment from outside world, in short jest are interaction from real world upon this test environment.

To summarize it:

| Environment | Prisma                      | Node                        | Database(PSQL)     | Justification                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dev         | dockerized locally          | local                       | dockerized locally | for fast development                                          |
| prod        | dockerized in prod server 1 | dockerized in prod server 1 | prod server 2      | for easy deployment in production                             |
| test        | dockerized in test server 1 | dockerized in test server 1 | test server 2      | to mimic production environment with free to torture database |
| jest        | none                        | none                        | none               | to interact with test environment                             |

As we can see we have 4 environments and setting up all the environments can be very time consuming even for experienced member who just join the team, let alone the beginner. To run the environments, we need to install all kind of software and configuring all of them, imagine all kinds of thing we need to do just to get the code run.

If the environments are too complicated to setup, it take our attention away from REAL engineering problem, I remember in my first job, we spent 80% of the time just to pick up the tool (if you are curious, it was Siemens software and Siemens is infamous for not so user friendly software).

Hence this motivates me to create and maintain well structured boilerplate, so that any newcomer that join the project can work on the code with minimum configuration. When we creating a boilerplate, alway put the team in mind, even if we are working alone, we also should do this because boilerplate that is convenient for a team definitely convenient for one man army too.

Docker refuse to add key that allows user to run a service or not because the developers want to uphold some silly engineering principle even though it is a highly requested feature https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1896, I have no choice but to create a seperate docker yml file for dev. Yes we can use --scale service=0 command, but that doesn't stop docker from building the service and building Node every time is not ideal for dev.

## Objective

The objective of this boilerplate is you should able to run it with just installing docker and use npm script to run command.

Prerequisite knowledge:

1. Graphql
2. Prisma library

What you need to have:

1. Docker
2. Kitematic(optional): Docker GUI\*
3. TeamSQL(optional): SQL database GUI\*
4. A PSQL database hosted online(for non-dev environment)\*\*

\*With or without Kitematic and TeamSQL, we still able to get the app running, but I strongly recommend them because they are powerful utilities  
\*\*I was unable to docker-compose PSQL and Prisma in Ubuntu(but no problem in Window and Mac). Hence to satisfy all three platforms, I decided to exclude PSQL from docker and this is actually a better decision because having database on the other server add security. Even if you dont have databse online, a demo database is ready for you, you can run test-setup with ease, but I still recommend you come up with your own online database for non-dev environment.

Here is instruction to get running:

1. to get dev up and run: npm run dev-setup\*

with just one script, our dev environment graphql playground automatically open in browser up and running, waiting for us to explore! We can also npm run test-setup to launch test-environment, it is a docker composed of both Node and Prisma server(wait a little and refresh browser if you see empty page). We need to create the prod.env ourself, it can be easily done by using test.env which is provided as template, please refer to ./config/dev.env for guidelines.

\*for Mac user, please change the value of PSQL_HOST in ./config/dev.env to docker.for.mac.localhost, do note that there is no similar support for Ubuntu(why you want to run dev in Ubuntu anyway?).

Did I mention this boilerplate also comes with:

1. commit hooked prettier styling
2. Babel env preset
3. basic data model
4. basic schema
5. basic api call
6. basic test (include subscription test)
7. basic CircleCI configuration file
8. basic JWT authentication

- npm run setup is for first time setup only, please explore other scripts to run the command you need(see documentation).
- if you are facing port is already allocated error, it is most likely you have postgres installed and running with 5433 port, change PSQL_PORT in ./config/dev.env
- to shut down container: npm run xxxx-down (xxx is dev or test or prod)

## Doc

The scripts is extended to 5 parts:

- basic
- jest
- prod
- test
- dev

prod, test and dev are derived from basic script, so that we can standardize how the script run. The scripts are mostly structured in the same way: prod and test scripts have 99% of similarity, the 1% is test-setup will open server endpoint in browser when it is ready (it will fails to open the browser in Ubuntu but it does no harm) while prod-setup will not; dev has slightly more scripts and much loosely structured so that you can develope with more flexible scripts; while jest only has 2 scripts.

Please study ./config/dev.env for better understanding on how environment variable works.
